This sample shows how to save a registration key -- actually it can be any binary data -- in the resources of any VFP application (executable file) any time after its compilation.

You know about "Other Files" section inside the Project Manager. I think, that would be handy to have a similar section named "Resources", where files like icons, bitmaps, sounds, strings and others could be added. And after the file compiled into an executable, they could be reached through the Resource API calls LoadResource, LoadString, LoadImage and so on.

The code explains how to use FindFirstPrinterChangeNotification and FindNextPrinterChangeNotification API calls to monitor changes in jobs for a specified local or network printer. Not an easy job for Visual FoxPro, considering its unique attitude to API structures and pointers. This functionality can be used to build a print monitor, though in a way limited by the single-thread nature of Visual FoxPro.
